# Purchasing execution queue — ONE CARD PER CHAT (line ⑦, opened 2026-07-27)

> **How to use (Jess):** new chat, paste:
> "Read `docs/purchasing-execution-queue.md`. Do card P<n> ONLY. Do not touch any other
> card. Do not redesign anything marked ALREADY EXISTS."
>
> **THE FLOW IS `docs/PURCHASING-WORKING-FLOW.md`** — nine sections, every action with its
> six things plus what it is counted per and what re-checks it. This file says WHAT to
> build; that file says HOW purchasing works. **The WORDS are the dictionary in
> `docs/COPY-STANDARD.md` — five strings per action, already written. Do not invent one.**
>
> **Lane rule:** P-cards edit the Purchasing pages — the same lane as ④ R-cards and ⑥ C4.
> Never run a P-chat alongside an R-chat or C4. A P-chat MAY run alongside a T/J/C1-C3
> chat (Orders lane) or an S-chat (Service).

## Ground truth (read before ANY card — measured on prod 2026-07-27)

- **The engine already exists and mostly works.** `buildPurchaseTodayReport`
  (`packages/shared/purchase-report.ts`) computes net requirements, the order-by date and
  the urgency buckets. `apps/api/src/routes/operation/purchase.ts` already reads a
  per-category lead time, a per-supplier work week, an arrival buffer and a **Mon/Wed/Fri**
  cadence. **This line is not a rebuild.** Anyone who proposes one has not read the code.
- **The numbers are hard-coded and the code says so.** `DEFAULT_LEAD_DAYS`
  (sofa 10 · bedframe 7 · mattress 7) · `SUPPLIER_OFF_DAYS` (keyed by CATEGORY, not
  supplier) · `ARRIVAL_BUFFER_WORKING_DAYS = 7` · `DEFAULT_REVIEW_DAYS = [1,3,5]`. Their own
  comments read *"editable via 0243 later … pending Jess"*. **Jess has now decided** —
  §2 of the flow file holds every value.
- **`suppliers.lead_time` is free TEXT and 8 of 10 suppliers are empty** (only Ohana
  "7-21 days" and Nice Future "7-10 days"). Nothing can compute from it.
- **THE NUMBERS ARE BEHIND FOUR DOORS, NOT ONE** (measured 2026-07-28 — P1 must close all
  four or it has not done its job):
  1. the hard-coded constants in `apps/api/src/routes/operation/purchase.ts`;
  2. **`PurchaseSettingsSheet.tsx`** — a read-only "Purchase settings" drawer already live
     behind the gear icon on the Purchasing tab bar, showing **PO days = Mon + Thu** (the
     engine runs Mon/Wed/Fri) and **Bed frame = Mon–Fri** (Ohana works Saturday). **A manager
     opening Settings today reads two numbers that are false;**
  3. **`delivery_fee_config.mattress_bedframe_lead_days` (14) and `sofa_lead_days` (21)** —
     two editable fields on Catalog → Delivery that **no code reads**. The real gate is the
     hard-coded `DELIVERY_LEAD_DAYS`. Editing them today changes nothing;
  4. `suppliers.lead_time` — free text, and after P1 it is a second place claiming to say how
     long a factory takes;
  5. **`PO_STOCK_LEAD_DAYS` in `packages/shared/src/schemas/ops-po-duty.ts` — mattress 7 ·
     bedframe 7 · SOFA 5.** This is the URGENT BYPASS: an order whose deadline falls inside
     this window jumps the Mon/Wed/Fri cadence and flags red on any day. It is live on the
     Orders control grid (`poUrgentBypass`), it is **the safety net**, and it is calibrated to
     a sofa taking 5 working days when the flow says 14. **The net fires nine days too late.**
     Sofa therefore has FOUR different numbers in the codebase today (10 · 5 · 14/10 · 14) and
     P1 must leave exactly one.
- **Only TWO suppliers can be purchased from** (live 2026-07-28): Nice Future × mattress
  (42 SKUs) and Ohana × bedframe + sofa (154 SKUs) — **three supplier × category pairs.** The
  other 8 suppliers carry ZERO SKUs. The settings matrix is DERIVED from which supplier
  actually has SKUs in a category; a 10 × 3 grid of empty boxes is the wrong screen.
- **Zero purchase orders exist.** `purchase_orders` = 0 rows. Every P-card must prove its
  path works by creating a real PO, not by reading an existing one.
- **The live migration tail is AHEAD of the repo.** 2026-07-28: the tracker holds `0301` +
  `0302` (the ④ R6 warehouse-login line) and neither file is on main. Number from the
  TRACKER, never from `ls supabase/migrations`.
- **One warehouse exists and one is all there will be**: `Carres Klang`. AL Sungai Buloh and
  HOUZS Balakong are **delivery addresses on a PO, never warehouse records** (Loo 2026-07-28).
- **`purchase_order_lines` already carries** `qty` · `received_qty` · `damaged_qty` ·
  `wrong_item_qty`, and that is the whole quantity model. Partial receiving is already
  quantity-based. **There is no `cancelled_qty` and none is coming** — purchasing does not
  model a cancellation (flow file §9).
- **Claims is ALREADY A TAB.** R2 added it 2026-07-27 (`PurchasingTabs.tsx` → `?tab=claims`);
  the engine is live (R2 · R3 · R4, `supplier_claims`, migrations 0288/0291/0299). Four of the
  five tabs exist today; Settings is the fifth and arrives with P1.
- **Everything in the database today is TEST data.** At go-live it starts clean. Never
  write a backfill or a repair job for existing rows.

## P1 · The numbers become settings

**Goal:** every number the purchasing engine uses stops being hard-coded and becomes
something Jess edits, with a record of who changed it and what it was before.

**ALREADY EXISTS — do not rebuild:** the engine, the order-by computation, the urgency
buckets, the Mon/Wed/Fri cadence, the working-day calendar
(`packages/shared/working-days.ts` + `my-holidays.ts` — purchasing NEVER computes its own).

**Build:**
1. A settings store for the numbers in `docs/PURCHASING-WORKING-FLOW.md` §2. **They are FOUR
   shapes, not one:** production time is per supplier × category · supplier work week is per
   supplier · PO days is a set of weekdays · the rest are single numbers.
2. **Sofa production time becomes 14 working days** (it is 10 in the code and 5 in a stale
   Orders comment — three different numbers today, all wrong). **Peak season is not a second
   set of numbers** — it is a manager raising this one to 20 and lowering it again (§2).
3. The supplier work week moves from being keyed by CATEGORY to being keyed by **supplier**
   (Nice Future 5-day · Ohana works Saturday). The category proxy is a known lie.
   **Sunday is never offered** — it is a non-working day for everyone (working-days law), and
   a checkbox for it would read as though it could be switched on.
4. A **Settings** tab on Purchasing, manager-only (`org_duties` key `ops_manager` — **no new
   duty key**), laid out per UI-KIT §8.3 (module-tab law) + §8.2 (interaction law). Every
   edit records who, when, and the previous value, and the previous value is ON SCREEN.
5. **Close all FIVE doors** (Ground truth above), not just the constants: delete the
   constants with NO fallback · retire `PurchaseSettingsSheet.tsx` and its gear icon · retire
   the two dead fields on Catalog → Delivery · stop `suppliers.lead_time` claiming to answer
   this question · **make the urgent bypass (`PO_STOCK_LEAD_DAYS`) read the same setting**.
   A fallback is how a setting silently stops mattering; a second door is how a manager edits
   a number and nothing happens; and the fifth door is the safety net firing late.
6. `DELIVERY_LEAD_DAYS` (the POS's earliest sellable date — mattress/bedframe 14, sofa 21
   CALENDAR days) becomes **one** editable number. **Seed 21** — the safe upper bound, so no
   order becomes sellable EARLIER than it is today. Jess sets 30 at go-live, on screen.
7. **A supplier × category with no number set is not defaulted to 7.** The row reads
   `Set a number` (K1's law) and that line's order-by date is not computed. A quiet screen
   must mean *watched and fine*, never *nobody looked*.
8. **This deploy changes exactly ONE behaviour: sofa 10 → 14.** Order-by buffer stays 7 (Jess
   sets 10 at go-live herself). One number at a time, so a surprise is traceable.

**Migration:** yes — a settings table. Draft to Jess first (guardrail #8); number from the
TRACKER at apply time, not from the repo (the tail is ahead — Ground truth).
**Order of operations:** apply the migration and verify it FIRST, then merge, then deploy.
Shipping code whose table does not exist yet 500s the Purchasing page.
**Done when:** Jess changes sofa production time on screen and the order-by date on the To
Order tab moves the same day; no purchasing number is hard-coded anywhere; and the gear-icon
drawer and the two Catalog → Delivery fields are gone.

### ✅ SHIPPED — what actually landed (2026-07-28)

Migration **0303** · four tables (`purchasing_settings` singleton ·
`purchasing_supplier_settings` · `purchasing_production_days` ·
`purchasing_setting_changes`) · four audited DEFINER RPCs, manager-gated on the existing
`ops_manager` duty — **no new duty key**. No table carries a write policy, so the
gate cannot be walked around over PostgREST.

**The rule that shaped the build (Jess 2026-07-28): a supplier × category with no number
does NOT fall back to 7.** `productionWorkingDaysFor` returns `null`, the line is held out
of the plan, the To Order tab names the pair, and the Settings screen says `Set a number`
(K1's rule). There is deliberately no per-category default column to fall back on, and a
sanity block in the migration fails if one ever appears.

**All FIVE doors closed:**
- `PurchaseSettingsSheet.tsx`, the read-only gear on To Order, **deleted**. It showed
  PO days as **Mon + Thu** (four days after Jess moved to Mon/Wed/Fri) and promised the
  values would become editable "when the lead-time table ships". This is that table.
- `delivery_fee_config.mattress_bedframe_lead_days` / `sofa_lead_days` — **editable in
  Catalog → Delivery, saved on every click, and read by nothing.** The inputs are retired;
  the columns stay (nothing is dropped) with no writer.
- `suppliers.lead_time` — free text ("7-21 days"), empty on 8 of 10 suppliers, printed as
  a `Lead time` stat on the Suppliers card and appended to its drawer subtitle. **Both
  retired**; the column is untouched in the DB, it simply stops being shown as an answer.
- **`PO_STOCK_LEAD_DAYS` — the urgent bypass, the fifth door — DELETED.** `poUrgentBypass`
  now takes a window in days, and its callers resolve that window from the production
  working days a human set (`purchasingUrgentWindowDays`, the LONGEST across the categories
  an order is short on — the safe direction: it flags early, never late). **A category with
  no number set gets a window of 0 and can never make an order urgent**, which is the same
  silence `Set a number` buys everywhere else, asserted by its own test.
- The constants themselves — **deleted, no fallback.**

**The safety net stops firing nine days late.** Sofa carried FOUR numbers (engine 10 ·
bypass 5 · the gear drawer 14/10 · the flow 14); the bypass now reads the same 14 as the
plan does, so an unsecured sofa order jumps the cadence when the flow says it should.

**Six of the seven numbers, plus one the card did not list.** `logistics_call_working_days`
(§2's "days before the delivery date the logistics call is raised") IS built and IS read —
Jess ruled on 2026-07-28 that a column with no reader is `ops_order_control.balance`'s
disease, so the two Orders-lane readers were wired in the same PR, changing nothing else.
Its label on screen is the action it raises (`Confirm delivery date`), because no word for
the setting itself exists in COPY-STANDARD.

**One behaviour change only** (Jess): sofa production time 10 → 14 working days. The
order-by buffer stays at today's 7 and the earliest-sell number collapses to **21** — the
upper of today's 14/21, so nothing becomes sellable EARLIER than it is today (a mattress
cart tightens from 14 to 21; Jess sets 30 at go-live).

## P2 · The click behaviour becomes real

**This card SHRANK on 2026-07-28.** Its old goal was "Claims becomes a tab" — **Claims is
already a tab.** R2 added it on 2026-07-27 (`PurchasingTabs.tsx` → `?tab=claims`), so four of
the five tabs in `docs/PURCHASING-WORKING-FLOW.md` §1 exist today and the fifth (Settings)
arrives with P1. Nothing about tabs is left to build.

**ALREADY EXISTS — do not rebuild:** the claim engine and its lifecycle (R2 · R3 · R4), the
Claims tab, the Receiving tab, the tables.

**The facet rail exists on ONE tab of four, not on all of them** (measured 2026-07-28 — the
earlier version of this card said "the facet rail" already exists, full stop, and a chat that
believed it would go looking for something that is not there):

| Tab | Facet rail | Filter state | What P2 owes it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **To Order** | yes | real — `supplierFilter` · `attn` · `selectedDay`, each with an `onClear` chip | the missing half of §8.2: **clicking the same tile again clears it**, and closing the drawer keeps the filter AND the scroll |
| **Purchase Orders** | — | — | check before building; it is a nested route, not a `?tab=` |
| **Receiving** | **none** | **none** | a rail and tiles from scratch |
| **Claims** | **none** | **none** | a rail and tiles from scratch |

**Build — the UI-KIT §8.2 interaction law:** click a queue tile → the table filters · click it
again / ✕ → it clears · two tiles → two ✕-able chips · click a row → the drawer opens on its
FIRST tab · closing keeps the filter AND the scroll position. **Orders is the reference — copy
it, do not invent it.**

**Do NOT extract a shared component for this.** UI-KIT §8.2's enforcement row says the
behaviour ends up inside `PageShell` / `DataTable`, and **that is card D0.5c on line ⑧**.
P2 makes the behaviour true on Purchasing; D0.5c is what stops it being written a fourth time.
A P-chat that starts building `PageShell` has taken another line's card.

**The queue tiles are the six in `docs/PURCHASING-WORKING-FLOW.md` §7**, and the sixth is
`Confirm what happens next`, NOT `Claims` — a tile's name is its action; `Claims` is the tab.

**LANE — read before opening a chat.** Receiving and Claims are ④ R's files, and **R6
(`warehouse files its own receiving`) is mid-flight**: `0301` / `0302` are applied to prod and
neither file is on main. P1 could ship beside R6 because it touched neither. **P2 touches
`OperationReceiving.tsx` directly.** Either wait for R6 to merge, or ship the To Order half
alone and leave the other two tabs until it lands — but never edit that file while R6 holds it.

**No migration.**
**Done when:** every queue tile on Purchasing filters and clears again, and the drawer gives
the list back exactly as it was left.

## P3 · The two missing supplier calls

**Goal:** build the two actions the portal has never had —
`Confirm tomorrow's delivery` and `Confirm balance delivery date`
(`docs/PURCHASING-WORKING-FLOW.md` §3; the five strings for each are already in the
dictionary).

**The business reason, in Jess's own words:** the day before the goods are due, a staff
member asks the supplier for the delivery order to confirm tomorrow's van — and that is when
the supplier says "it will be late". And when the van arrives short, somebody has to ask when
the balance comes.

**Build:**
1. `Confirm tomorrow's delivery` — appears the working day before the expected arrival,
   closes on a recorded answer (shipping / delayed with a new date), counted per PO.
2. **A "delayed" answer opens Delay planning** — the Orders flow's stage 1, unchanged. It
   never opens a call to the customer.
3. `Confirm balance delivery date` — appears when a line is part-received with no date for
   the balance, counted per PO line.
4. **Every supplier promise is kept as history**, not overwritten: previous date, new date,
   who, when, reason. A single "latest date" column can never answer *how often does this
   supplier move the date* — which is exactly what R5's scorecard needs.

**Migration:** yes — the answer records and the promise history. Draft to Jess first.
**Done when:** a supplier who says "late" on the phone the day before produces a Delay
planning action by itself, and a short delivery produces exactly one balance call.

## P4 · Where the goods go

**Goal:** a PO says where the supplier must send the goods, and prints it.

**Build:**
1. Destinations: `Carres Klang` (our own warehouse) · `AL Sungai Buloh` · `HOUZS Balakong`.
   **AL and HOUZS are DELIVERY ADDRESSES, not warehouses** (Loo 2026-07-28) — do NOT create
   `warehouses` rows for them. Carres has exactly one warehouse and a second warehouse entity
   would put goods we do not count into every stock rollup.
2. The choice sits on the PO and appears on the printed PO.
3. **Nice Future is fixed** — it does not deliver: `collected by NETS → Carres Klang` is its
   only option, and the PO says so.
4. Default for everyone else is `Carres Klang`.
5. **The supplier-facing PDF prints no RM value of any kind** (Loo 2026-07-28): PO number ·
   supplier · items · quantity · delivery address · delivery instructions · dates. The
   purchase price stays internal. Check `PoDocumentPreview.tsx` against this before adding
   the address — the rule is about the whole document, not only the new field.

**Why it matters:** an outstation order can only be delivered by AL, and AL will not collect
in Klang. Sending the goods straight to AL saves a whole transfer.

**NOT in this card:** moving goods we already own (the Lalamove run that takes pillows and
mattress protectors from Klang to AL). That is a **stock transfer** and belongs to the Stock
line — putting it here would mix "buying" and "moving" in one place and neither would
reconcile.

**Migration:** yes — locations + the PO's destination. Draft to Jess first.
**Done when:** a printed PO tells the supplier exactly where to send the goods, and Nice
Future's PO can only say one thing.

## P5 · Prove it with a real PO

**Goal:** the whole line has never run. Take one real customer order from To Order through
Send PO → ready date → tomorrow's call → check in (part) → balance call → fully received,
and fix whatever breaks.

**This is a card, not a test plan.** Zero POs exist, so every earlier card is theory until
one goes end to end.

**Build / fix as found:**
1. The two gates that have no home yet: a PO cannot be sent twice for the same customer line
   and quantity; a check-in cannot be posted twice for the same supplier delivery order
   number.
2. Whoever is on an action shows on it (`Yu Jun is handling this · started 10:14`) — everybody
   can see everybody's work, so two people WILL open the same action. **Store it as a
   lightweight claim** — `(action identity) → claimed by → claimed at` — expiring on
   `ACTION_CLAIM_TIMEOUT_MS` (already exported from `packages/shared/order-actions.ts`;
   **import it, never retype the number**), and read it ONLY through the open-action list so a
   finished or recomputed-away action cannot carry one (flow §5). **`ops_tasks` already has `claimed_by`/`claimed_at` and is still the
   wrong home**: minting a task row per engine action turns the ladder back into a manual
   to-do list, which is the one thing ACTION-FLOW-STANDARD forbids. Reuse the shape, not the
   table.
3. One PO document really does carry several customers' lines (§1), and one customer order
   really does need several POs. Prove both on the real run, not on a fixture.

**`cancelled_qty` is NOT in this card any more** (Loo 2026-07-28): purchasing does not model a
cancellation at all. A customer cancellation needs management approval and belongs to the
Orders cancellation policy; purchasing keeps processing a valid PO until Operations says stop,
and stopping is the whole PO (`purchase_orders.status = 'cancelled'`, already built).

**Migration:** likely. Draft to Jess first.
**Done when:** one real PO has gone the whole way, including a short delivery, and every
number on screen matches what actually happened.

## Reported, not built (recorded so nobody rediscovers them late)

- **PO revisions — RULED OUT, not deferred** (Loo 2026-07-28). A sent PO is never edited: more
  items means a NEW PO, and stopping one means cancelling the whole PO. There is no version of
  a sent document to keep, so the gap this line used to describe does not exist.
- **The finer quantities** (`in_transit_qty`, `ready_for_collection_qty`,
  `supplier_confirmed_qty`). Not built: a column nobody writes is worse than a missing one —
  that is exactly how `ops_order_control.balance` became a lock reading a NULL for months.
- **The September switch.** Nice Future stops supplying in September; a new mattress supplier
  takes over on the subscription model. Sofa and bed frame unchanged. Its own line when it
  comes.
