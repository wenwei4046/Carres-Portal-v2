# WORKSPACE — MASTER

> **APPROVED / LOCKED by Jess, 2026-09-03 / sequencing approved 2026-09-04.** This is the one
> Workspace authority for Staff & Duties, action/approval ownership, Work and the future Dashboard.
> Modules own business facts and completion; Workspace coordinates them. There is no second
> Workspace Blueprint.

## 1 · Mission and boundary

```text
Dashboard   what management needs to know
Work        what someone needs to do
```

`Workspace → Staff & Duties` answers who holds each ERP Duty today, who covers an absence and who
actually acted. Workspace does not own module records or their completion facts.

Carres has one cross-module Work coordination surface. Module Registers, queues and action views
may show the same obligation, but never become separate Work Engines. One obligation retains one
identity, owner rule, due rule, completion fact and deep link everywhere.

## 2 · Action admission contract

An action enters Work only when its owning module supplies:

| Fact | Law |
|---|---|
| Work identity | Stable module + rule + source object + occurrence identity |
| Trigger | Stored condition that opened the obligation |
| Owning module | Owner of trigger and completion truth |
| Source | Canonical object identity and exact deep link |
| Fact/problem | Concrete first line; no generic `Pending`, `Handle` or `Follow up` |
| Action | Governed action; owner is metadata, never sentence prose |
| Required result | Exact fact the operator must produce |
| Completion | Measured by the owning module; Work has no manual `Done` |
| Owner rule | Stable person rule or Duty key, never a hard-coded person |
| Due | Exact date/time and calendar, or governed `No date` |
| Blocker | Named dependency; waiting alone is not blocked |
| Next | Governed consequence, not a Workspace promise |

Workspace reads projections and opens the owning write door. It never copies the business record,
assigns routine work independently, changes its due date or closes it.

## 3 · Duty, owner, cover and actor

> **An Action has an Owner. A business object does not have one universal action owner.**

```text
Action rule
→ named Duty or governed person rule
→ Primary holder / normal owner
→ active Buddy cover
→ acting person today
→ immutable actual actor when the result is recorded
```

Duty, normal owner, active cover, acting person and actual actor are separate facts. History stores
the effective assignment, cover, actor, decision and time. A later holder change updates current and
future routing everywhere but never rewrites history.

## 4 · Staff & Duties

`Workspace → Staff & Duties` is the only assignment surface. An authorised manager assigns one
Primary holder and optional effective-dated Buddy cover to each named Duty and can see immutable
assignment history.

Modules store only `rule → required Duty`. They never store another staff list, local approver,
hard-coded Jess/Manager identity or page-level cover calculation. People/HR supplies active,
employment and leave facts; Workspace owns Duty assignments; the Shared Duty Resolver combines
them.

Distinct Duties include Payment Duty, Storage Waiver Approver, Payment Approver, Purchasing
Approver, Delivery Charge Approver, Stock Adjustment Approver and Service Case Approver. There is
no fake `ERP Owner`.

A missing holder is `Not assigned`, never a silent PIC/email/manager fallback. The action remains
visible to authorised supervision with a Staff & Duties door.

Current Operation roster effective 2026-09-07: Yu Jun and Shasha. Khor Yee is departed and may
appear only in immutable historical actor, employment, assignment or cover evidence; she is never a
current/future Duty holder, cover, acting person, My Work recipient or Team Work group.

## 5 · My Work and Team Work

```text
My Work     actions routed to the signed-in acting person today
Team Work   the same actions grouped by normal owner
```

- My Work is the default for everyone, including managers, and omits their repeated avatar.
- Team Work groups under owner avatar/name; cover appears only when today's actor differs.
- No manual `Take it`, `Release`, generic assignment or `Mark done` exists for deterministic work.
- Ordering is broken commitment, late, today, then later; blockers never hide lateness.
- Completed/History is read-only source evidence and preserves the actual actor.

## 6 · Module admission gate

A page displaying an action sentence is not enough. A module joins Work only with:

1. authoritative trigger and completion fact;
2. stable identity and occurrence law;
3. named person rule or Duty key resolved centrally;
4. governed due/calendar or explicit no-date law;
5. required result, recipient where applicable and exact source door;
6. permission/history evidence preserving the actual actor;
7. tests proving source completion removes the same Work identity.

Incomplete projections are excluded and reported as a Work-health gap. Workspace never fills a
missing module rule with a global default.

## 7 · Right Rail and Notifications

The Right Rail is counts and navigation into main My Work:

```text
My Work
Late
Due today
Open My Work
```

It contains no independent calculation, row, Duty editor, cover chip, assignment or completion
control. Selecting a count opens My Work with the filter visibly applied.

Notifications are event receipts—assigned, cover activated, became late, unblocked, source failed
or completed. Read/dismiss never changes Work. The Bell is not a second queue.

## 8 · Dashboard admission law

Dashboard is built after core module projections are stable. It admits only facts that change
management intervention, commitment risk or confidence:

- broken customer, supplier or delivery commitments;
- missing Duty holder or cover;
- Work source/integrity failure;
- material customer, goods or cash risk;
- workload health and valid trends;
- recent material change with an exact owning-object door.

Dashboard contains no action queue, manual completion, copied report or arbitrary KPI card. Every
number has one governed drill-down. A failed source never appears as zero.

### 8.1 · Dashboard composition

Dashboard is the management reading surface over authoritative module facts and the shared Work
contract. It answers, in this order:

1. Is a customer, supplier, delivery or payment commitment already broken?
2. Is material customer, goods or cash exposure increasing?
3. Can the accountable people act today, or is ownership/cover/source integrity broken?
4. Where is intervention changing the trend?

The desktop composition is:

```text
┌ Dashboard ─────────────────────────────── Refreshed 09:42 · All sources healthy ┐
│ MANAGEMENT ATTENTION                                                        │
│ 3 broken customer commitments  2 supplier promises broken  1 Work source failed│
│ Each fact is a drill-down aggregate; no action sentence or Done control.     │
├ COMMITMENT HEALTH ───────────────────────┬ MATERIAL EXPOSURE ─────────────────┤
│ Customer delivery · broken / due today   │ Customer cases · significant/critical│
│ Supplier promise · broken / no answer    │ Goods · shortage/quarantine/blocked │
│ Delivery result · missing / failed       │ Cash · overdue balance/recovery      │
│ Payment promise · overdue                │ Direction vs previous governed period│
├ WORK HEALTH ─────────────────────────────┼ RECENT MATERIAL CHANGE ─────────────┤
│ Open · late · blocked · no owner/cover   │ Time · fact changed · object door    │
│ Load by normal owner; cover shown apart  │ Only changes that alter intervention │
│ Oldest late and ageing distribution      │ Never a copied activity stream       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────┘
```

`Management attention` contains only non-zero intervention facts. A fact identifies its measure,
scope and oldest/amount context, then opens the already-filtered owning Register or Team Work. It
does not list individual actions. When no intervention is required it says `No management attention
needed` and still shows source freshness; it never celebrates a failed source as a clear desk.

`Commitment health` uses explicit promises only. An internal estimate, open PO, active order or
pipeline stage is not a broken commitment. Each row shows `Broken · Due today · Due later` only where
the owning module has a governed date and completion fact. Selecting a row opens the owning module,
not a Dashboard drawer.

`Material exposure` admits only consequences that can change a management decision: significant or
critical customer cases, quarantined/blocked goods, material shortage, overdue customer cash and
unrecovered issue cost. Currency never nets incurred, recoverable and recovered. Threshold and
period come from the owning module/settings and appear in the drill-down evidence.

`Work health` is the only Dashboard reading of Work. It aggregates the same server feed by normal
owner, acting cover, lateness, blocker and source health. Selecting it opens Team Work with the exact
filter. It never repeats My Work rows or treats `Not assigned` as somebody's queue.

`Recent material change` is not an activity feed. It includes only a newly broken/recovered
commitment, material exposure crossing its governed threshold, owner/cover/source failure or a
material recovery. Each receipt states the changed fact, time and exact object door.

### 8.2 · Measure contract and source health

Every Dashboard measure carries:

| Fact | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Identity | stable measure key and owning module |
| Meaning | one sentence defining included and excluded records |
| Value | count, amount, age or rate with unit |
| As of | source observation time and business date |
| Comparison | governed prior period or none; never a decorative percentage |
| Threshold | named module rule where attention depends on a threshold |
| Coverage | included population and permission scope |
| Drill-down | one filtered owning Register or Team Work destination |
| Health | healthy · delayed · failed; last successful observation preserved |

Partial source failure is isolated. Healthy sections remain visible; the affected measure reads
`Could not load {source}` with `Last available {time}` where safe. A whole-page failure appears only
when the Dashboard composition itself cannot be validated. Retry re-reads sources and never changes
business state.

### 8.3 · Dashboard vocabulary

Use: `Management attention` · `Commitment health` · `Material exposure` · `Work health` ·
`Recent material change` · `Broken` · `Due today` · `Due later` · `Blocked` · `Not assigned` ·
`Covered by` · `Last available` · `Could not load` · `Open Team Work` · `Open {module}`.

Do not use: `At Risk` · `SLA` · `Open POs` as an alert · `Active pipeline` as management health ·
`to action` · `All on track` without source evidence · `No alerts ✓` · `Escalations` for an
unreviewed annotation · `Upcoming` · `Take it` · `Release`.

### 8.4 · Responsive behaviour

- At 1440px and above, use the two-column reading order shown in section 8.1; attention spans both.
- At 1024–1439px, keep attention full width and stack each paired section in a single column.
- Below 1024px, use one continuous document: source health, attention, commitment, exposure, Work
  health, recent changes. No horizontal pipeline, compressed five-column board or sideways KPI strip.
- Counts and amounts never truncate. Long measure explanations wrap; object doors remain keyboard and
  touch accessible. Hover-only source/threshold evidence also opens by focus/tap.
- Right Rail remains a My Work navigation peek beside Dashboard on supported desktop widths; it is
  not folded into Dashboard. On narrow screens its existing navigation door remains separate.

### 8.5 · Current → proposed gap audit — 2026-09-07

| Current production | Decision |
|---|---|
| `Today`, `Open POs`, `Overdue` KPI tiles | Replace with governed intervention facts; an open PO is not itself a problem |
| Active orders and GMV hero | Remove unless a governed comparison/threshold proves management relevance |
| Five-column order pipeline with recent order cards | Remove from Dashboard; Sales Orders owns its Register and flow views |
| Open Purchase Orders card | Remove; show only broken supplier promise/no-answer commitments from Purchasing truth |
| Low Stock plus separate Stock Alerts/Reorder queries | Replace with one material goods-exposure measure after Stock defines threshold, site scope and drill-down |
| Emoji Escalation inbox from annotations | Remove; an annotation is not a reviewed escalation or Work transition |
| Multiple client queries with independent loading states | Replace with one validated Dashboard composition carrying per-source health |
| `See all orders`, `Manage POs`, `Open warehouse` generic doors | Replace with one exact filtered owning-module drill-down per measure |
| Whole-page RPC error | Retain retry, add per-source health and last-safe observation; never turn failure into zero |

No Dashboard production rebuild begins until each admitted measure has the section 8.2 contract and
its owning module is production-verified. This blocks invented totals, not the already-honest Work
surface.

## 9 · Delivery sequence

Workspace is not wholly deferred until every ERP module is complete:

```text
NOW
Staff & Duties → Shared Duty Resolver

WITH EACH MODULE
action projection → owner Duty/person rule → due/calendar
→ completion fact → exact deep link and history evidence

AFTER CORE MODULES CONVERGE
My Work → Team Work → module-rail previews → Notifications

LAST
Dashboard → management facts → cross-module trends → production validation
```

Core admission covers Sales Orders, Purchasing, Receiving, Stock/Warehouse, Delivery, Payment,
Service Cases and Issue Tracker. Catalog, Guarantee and Rental may join later; they do not block
honest Work for admitted modules.

## 10 · Measured implementation truth — 2026-09-06

- Migration 0425's shared Duty registry/resolver, effective primary assignment, dated cover,
  audit evidence, guarded API and the one `Workspace → Staff & Duties` UI are production-proven
  for GRN Duty. The same catalogue now exposes the other approved cross-module Duty names; their
  module consumers remain implementation evidence until each module is production-verified.
- Order and Manual Purchase Work now carry structured owner rule, Duty key, normal owner, active
  cover and acting person. My Work routes to the acting person; Team Work retains the normal owner.
  Payment and PO work no longer borrow the order PIC when their Duty is unresolved.
- `/api/operation/po-duty` remains only as the response-shape adapter listed in the Purchasing
  MASTER. Remaining Purchasing screens and the PO-day reminder must move to the Workspace contract
  before that adapter is deleted.
- `GET /api/operation/work` is now the one server-composed feed for admitted Sales Orders,
  Manual Purchase, Purchase Order supplier-reply and Receiving actions. Purchase Order reply work
  reads the exact current-version send and evidenced supplier-answer facts, resolves PO Duty and
  opens the exact PO; it does not restore the retired browser composition. The feed reuses the owning modules' reads and projectors;
  invalid source data fails visibly instead of presenting a false clear desk.
- My Work, Team Work and the Quick Rail My Work counts read that same cached response. The
  retired browser composition and Quick Rail Team/duty editor have been removed.
- My Work is the default for everyone. It routes by acting person; Team Work groups by normal
  owner and shows dated cover evidence without rewriting ownership.
- Stock/Warehouse admission was re-audited against the production-verified replacement Monitor,
  Inbound and Outbound surfaces on 2026-09-07. Supplier arrivals already enter through Receiving's
  GRN-owned action; Monitor is read-only management visibility and creates no Work. Physical
  Outbound work is deliberately not admitted yet: its approved owner is an individually signed-in
  NETS Warehouse operator, falling back to an authorised Site queue until accepted, while the
  current central Work endpoint is Operation-only and has neither Site-queue routing nor personal
  acceptance facts. Naming Carres staff, `NETS` or a shared warehouse login would violate section 3.
- Delivery-owned arrangement, company assignment, customer booking, delivery-day result, proof and
  loan-return actions now retain Delivery as their module in the shared engine. Their stable object
  is the Delivery scope until a Delivery Order exists, then the exact DO where the result/proof act
  belongs; the server supplies the Delivery editor/DO door. The source Sales Order remains linked
  context and is no longer presented as the universal owner of those actions.
- Payment collection now enters from the complete issued-Invoice register, not a second Sales Order
  balance calculation. The shared readiness and collection clock admit only due/late balances whose
  goods are ready or have a real arrival date; Payment Duty/cover owns the action, the exact Invoice
  is the object/door, and only an atomic allocated payment reducing outstanding to RM 0 completes it.
  A sent message remains evidence and bank matching remains later evidence; neither is a second
  settlement step nor closes Work.
- Service Case admission was re-audited against the approved Service MASTER and shipped case plan,
  deadline clock and case API on 2026-09-07. The one deadline action (`Call {customer} — say why it
  is taking longer`) already has an authoritative trigger, 14-working-day deadline, exact case door
  and completion event tied to the deadline in force. It is deliberately not admitted yet because
  routine Service Case work has no governed person rule or Duty key: production describes the whole
  module only as Operation-scoped. `Service Case Approver` governs case decisions, not routine
  customer calls, and must not be reused as a convenient fallback. The other derived case follow-ups
  also have no step owner or governed per-step due law. Workspace therefore reports this as an
  admission gap and does not invent an `Operation team` owner, a global fallback or duplicate task
  rows. Their outcome dates remain the authoritative completion facts in the Service Case.
- Issue Tracker admission was re-audited against its approved MASTER, migration 0352, shared input
  contract, API and shipped Register on 2026-09-07. Production currently stores the action owner
  name and action parts as mutable Issue columns, then creates a second free-text `ops_tasks` row.
  The person id is optional, no Duty/person rule or Buddy-cover evidence is resolved, and the UI
  repeats the owner inside the action sentence. There is also no authoritative result write that
  completes/replaces the current action identity and no deep link that opens the exact Issue. These
  records therefore fail sections 2, 3 and 6 and are not admitted to shared Work. Repair must make
  the Issue's structured current-action transition the single truth, resolve its owner rule through
  Workspace, preserve actual-actor history, expose exact Issue routing and retire the duplicate
  generated task only after source-by-source migration proof.
- Notifications were re-audited against the shipped global Bell on 2026-09-07. The current Bell is
  not a notification system: it independently recomputes overdue/near-delivery Orders, reads legacy
  `ops_tasks`, labels the result `to action` and opens Orders. That is a second action queue and can
  disagree with My Work, so it is not accepted as Workspace truth. No durable Work-transition receipt,
  recipient, unread/dismiss evidence or source-failure event store exists yet. Browser polling or
  local storage must not fabricate that history. The replacement must persist idempotent receipts
  from admitted Work identity transitions (`assigned`, `cover activated`, `became late`, `unblocked`,
  `source failed`, `completed`), scope them to the affected person/supervision, and keep read/dismiss
  independent from Work. Until that source exists, the legacy Bell remains measured debt, not a
  completed Workspace feature.
- Dashboard was re-audited against its RPC, route, client composition and all shipped tiles on
  2026-09-07. The current page remains an old order-pipeline prototype with duplicated PO/stock/order
  calculations and an annotation inbox; it is not accepted as management truth. Sections 8.1–8.5
  now govern the replacement composition, measure/source-health contract, exact vocabulary,
  responsive layout and current-to-proposed cutover. Production rebuild remains last and begins only
  when every admitted measure has a verified owner, definition, threshold where applicable and exact
  drill-down.
- Several module MASTERs are approved while target implementation remains incomplete.
- Dashboard must wait; totals built now would preserve incomplete and duplicate calculations.

## 11 · Next governed work

1. Production-verify Staff & Duties and the Shared Duty Resolver.
2. Require every core module to expose the section 2 projection.
3. Remove legacy PIC/duty fallbacks.
4. Add permission-scoped Warehouse Site queues and personal operator acceptance/resolution, then
   admit physical Outbound actions; never turn Monitor events into actions.
5. Define a routine Service Case owner rule/Duty (separate from approval) and decide whether its
   derived follow-ups are governed `No date` actions or receive per-step clocks; then admit only the
   qualified projections to the server feed.
6. Replace Issue Tracker's stored owner prose and duplicate `ops_tasks` creation with a governed
   owner rule, versioned current-action result transition and exact Issue deep link; migrate existing
   truth before admitting it to Work.
7. Retire remaining duplicate generated-task paths after source-by-source proof.
8. Replace the legacy Bell queue with durable, idempotent Work-transition receipts and migrate the
   header to those receipts; read/dismiss must never alter Work.
9. Last, complete and owner-review Dashboard against production data.

Cards follow dependency slices; this MASTER is not an implementation queue.

## 12 · Done-when

- one Duty registry resolves every admitted action/approval;
- one holder change updates all routing, My Work and Team Work;
- leave activates Buddy cover without overwriting normal owner;
- source completion closes one stable Work identity;
- actual actor and approval evidence remain immutable;
- no module has an independent staff list, approver name or cover resolver;
- Right Rail and Notifications read the same Work truth;
- Dashboard reads verified facts and never becomes another queue;
- production verification precedes every completion claim.
