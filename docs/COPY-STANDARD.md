## Why this exists

Every screen the operations team uses must let a no-experience operator do
their job without asking anyone. **Text is the training.** Icons alone do not
teach. This document is the standard for how to write that text so a new hire
can walk up, read the screen, and act.

Two hard beliefs behind the rules:

1. **Words are the interface** for a productivity tool. "Minimal text" is a
   mobile / marketing dogma — it does not apply here.
2. **Same word, same meaning, everywhere.** Synonyms across pages are the
   #1 reason a new hire gets confused ("Is 'Chase' the same as 'Follow up'?").

---

## The 10 rules

| # | Rule | ✘ Bad | ✔ Good |
|---|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Button = verb + object | `OK` · `Submit` · `Send` (alone) | `Issue PO to Ohana` |
| 2 | One action → one word | mix send / raise / place | `Issue PO` everywhere |
| 3 | Numbers up front | `There are 2 POs to issue` | `2 to issue · 1 past the order-by date` |
| 4 | Skip the obvious | `Below is the list of suppliers` | (just show the list) |
| 5 | Empty states teach | `No results` | `No purchase orders to issue.` |
| 6 | Errors give the fix | `Invalid input` | `Master row missing G column. Ask Sales to fill it before Monday.` |
| 7 | Tooltip = WHY | button `Issue PO` · tip `Click to issue` | button `Issue PO` · tip `Creates the PO number and the document Ohana receives` |
| 8 | Same word app-wide | Orders `Confirm ready date` · Purchase `Follow up` | Both say `Confirm ready date` |
| 9 | Zero jargon — **unless the team already says it** | requisition · expedite · MRP · `GRN` as a VERB | order · call · plan · check in · `GRN` as the DOCUMENT (see the document/act split) |
| 10 | Cut a sentence if possible | `Please note that this order...` | `This order is 1 day late. Issue PO now.` |

## The three "who / what / when" questions

Before writing any string, answer:

1. **Who** reads this? (new operator · manager · customer)
2. **What** do they do next?
3. **Which** specific name / number / date do they need?

If any answer is missing, the sentence is not written yet.

---

## Row action-line template

Every list row ends with a plain-English sentence telling the reader the next
action. **Length ≤ 10 words.** Shape:

    [Verb] + [Object with a name] + [When or why]

Examples (all pass):

    ✔ Issue PO to Ohana today.                 (5 words)
    ✔ Remind Nice Future — PO-86 due Fri.      (7 words)
    ✔ Call Ohana — confirm PO-88 ready date.   (7 words)
    ✔ Check in from Ohana (3 items).           (6 words)

Anti-patterns (all fail):

    ✘ Process order.                           (no name · no timing · abstract verb)
    ✘ You should follow up with the factory... (passive · no name · too long)
    ✘ Handle this.                             (all three failures)
    ✘ Awaiting action.                         (passive · does not say WHO acts)

---

## "What to do" step block template

For a detail pane / drawer where a full task is executed. Rules:

- **Max 4 steps.**
- **Each step ≤ 8 words.**
- **Each step starts with one verb.**
- Include the specific name / number / URL in the step.

Example (good):

    What to do:
    1. WhatsApp Ohana (012-3456).
    2. Send the SKU list above.
    3. Ask for ETA.
    4. Click Issue PO.

Anti-pattern (too wordy):

    What to do:
    1. Open your WhatsApp application and locate the contact "Ohana"
       who is the manager of the sofa factory we work with regularly.
    2. Please make sure you copy the SKU list from the table above,
       being careful not to miss any of the items shown...

If a step needs a paragraph of explanation, it belongs in a separate help
article, not in the "What to do" block.

---

## Empty-state pattern

Every empty state answers three things: (a) **why** it is empty · (b) **when**
it will change · (c) **what** the reader should do meanwhile.

Examples:

    ✔ "No purchase orders to issue. Check back after 2 PM when Master syncs."
    ✔ "0 calls to make · everything on track. Nothing to do here."
    ✔ "No goods arriving today. Ohana's next delivery is Thu 24 Jul."

Anti-patterns:

    ✘ "No data."
    ✘ "Empty."
    ✘ "Nothing to display."

---

## Error pattern

Errors tell the reader: (a) **what** broke · (b) **how** to fix it · (c) **who**
to ask if they can't.

Examples:

    ✔ "Master row missing G column. Ask Sales to fill it before Monday."
    ✔ "Ohana's phone number is not in Suppliers. Ask a manager to add it."
    ✔ "PO already issued — you cannot issue it again. If wrong, click Cancel."

Anti-patterns:

    ✘ "Invalid input."
    ✘ "Error 500."
    ✘ "Something went wrong."

---

## Tooltip pattern

The visible label says **WHAT**. The tooltip says **WHY**. They must not repeat.

    Label "Issue PO"    · tooltip "Creates the PO number and the document Ohana receives."
    Label "Late 2d"     · tooltip "Order-by was 20 Jul; today is 22 Jul."
    Label "No deadline" · tooltip "This order's Master row has no G column."

If the tooltip would just re-state the label, delete the tooltip.

---

## Action naming law (Jess ruling 2026-07-27 — supersedes the T2 version)

Every visible ACTION label (queue name, ladder pill, drawer button, checklist
row, follow-up preset) is written as:

    [Verb] + [clear object]
    — and the NAMED PARTY whenever an outside party is involved.

- **Name the party when there is one.** `Assign logistics`, `Issue delivery order` and
  `Upload delivery photo` involve nobody outside, so they carry no party and are correct as
  they stand. Use the actual person/company when the system knows it
  (`Call Ohana — confirm PO-88 ready date` · `Call NETS — confirm delivery
  date`); the role word (`customer`, `supplier`) only when no name exists.
- **The object is measurable.** "Contacted the supplier" completes nothing —
  the label names the business outcome (a ready date, a delivery slot, an
  amount collected, a photo uploaded).
- **No abbreviations, ever.** ERP shorthand a new hire must google is banned.
  **"POD" is banned** (→ delivery photo). **"Chase" is banned** (Jess
  2026-07-27) — it names a mood, not an outcome; every former Chase label
  becomes a Call with a named party and a measurable object. **"DO", "PO" and
  "GRN" survive because the team already speaks them daily** — and all three
  survive as the NAME OF A DOCUMENT, never as a verb.

### The document / act split (Loo ruled 2026-07-28)

**A word may name the piece of paper, the act, or neither — never both.** `GRN` is the
document the warehouse produces; **`Check in` is what a human does.** Same event, two words,
and that is correct rather than a synonym problem.

**The test, and it is mechanical:** replace the word with *"the piece of paper"*. If the
sentence still means what it meant — `View GRN`, `3 GRNs on this PO`, `GRN-0012` — the word is
right. If it does not — `+ GRN`, `Save GRN`, `GRN — goods arrived` — a human is DOING
something, and the word is `Check in`.

**Why this and not a clean ban.** The abbreviation rule above bans shorthand a new hire must
google, and exempts `DO` and `PO` on one ground: the team already says them. **`GRN` clears
exactly that bar** — it is what their AutoCount calls the document and what the warehouse says
out loud. Banning it would have put a word on screen the warehouse does not use, to satisfy a
rule whose own exemption already covered it.

**This applies to every module,** and the same split settles the next argument of this shape:
name the act with a verb from the table, name the artefact with the artefact's real name.
- **Every label lives in ONE place** — the audit table below ("The dictionary"). There is
  no second list of approved labels anywhere.

## Where the engine law lives

**This file defines WORDING only.** Action behaviour → `docs/ACTION-FLOW-STANDARD.md` ·
a module's workflow → `docs/<MODULE>-WORKING-FLOW.md` · execution queues →
`docs/execution-queues-index.md`. A rule lives in one document and is never copied here.

## The delivery queue words (re-ruled by Jess 2026-07-27 — this is the only version)

The delivery lifecycle is FOUR queues; the queue's label IS the row's top
checklist item. The list is closed; a new chat does not add a fifth:

| Step | The label |
|---|---|
| 1 | `Assign logistics` |
| 2 | `Confirm delivery date` (row line: `Call {logistics} — confirm delivery date`) |
| 3 | `Deliver today` |
| 4 | `Upload delivery photo` |

**Only the words live here.** What each queue holds and when it goes late are TRIGGERS and
DUE conditions — they live in `docs/ORDERS-WORKING-FLOW.md` §3, and nowhere else (Law 0A).
This table used to carry them; C2 found the copy and it was deleted rather than kept in
step.

Every deadline is counted in **working days** (see the one definition above) — the same
engine procurement uses. Lateness is written as the count
tail, numbers up front: `5 · 2 late`.

**`Issue delivery order` IS an action** (Jess 2026-07-27): once the customer's date is
confirmed, the SYSTEM produces the document and the operator only presses the button —
nobody authors a delivery order by hand. Card C7 builds it; the number is stamped at
dispatch today, which is too late to hand to logistics, and C7 moves it.

## The delivery group words (T8, locked with Jess 2026-07-27)

What may travel apart, and what may never. There are exactly TWO groups, and a
group is one atom — the words below name groups, never individual items:

| Group | The word | What it holds | May it go alone? |
|---|---|---|---|
| bed | **Bed set** | Mattress + bed frame | Yes — but never one without the other |
| sofa | **Sofa** | Sofa lines | Yes, on a second trip, ONLY if the customer agreed |

Accessories (pillow, mattress protector) belong to no group and are never
named in a trip: they never block a delivery, they are back-ordered.

Fixed phrasings — reuse these, do not invent variants:

- Split offer (only when part is ready and part is not):
  `Sofa not ready yet. Ask the customer:` + `Wait for everything` /
  `Deliver Bed set now`
- Confirmed partial trip: `Bed set only` (pill) ·
  `Bed set only — Sofa follows on a second trip` (activity line)
- What is still owed: row `Second trip` → `Sofa still to deliver` +
  `Book second trip`, or `stock not in yet` when it cannot be booked.

**Never** write "partial delivery", "split shipment", "back-order" or
"consignment" on screen — say what goes and what follows, in furniture words.

## The dictionary — every visible word, audited (Jess 2026-07-27)

**First, the distinction that stops the arguing.** Screen text is one of TWO kinds, and
mixing them is what produced words like "need booking":

| Kind | Must read as | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| **ACTION** — what a human does next | verb + **named party** + **measurable object** | NEXT column · queue names · buttons · drawer checklist |
| **FACT** — what is true right now | a name, a date, a number | delivery column · badges · timeline |

**The trap is the third kind: a FACT that is secretly a to-do.** `need booking` ·
`Unscheduled` · `Pending` · `At Risk` · `Attention` — they describe a GAP, so the reader
still has to work out what to do. **Rule: a fact may state an absence (`No logistics`), but
it may never contain a to-do word (`need`, `pending`, `required`, `TBD`, `at risk`).**
If the sentence is about a gap, write the ACTION that closes it.

### THE DICTIONARY — five strings per action (locked 2026-07-27)

**An action appears on screen in FIVE places, and all five are locked here.** Four
were being invented per chat, which is why the same action read three different
ways on three screens.

| # | The string | Where it shows |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Queue tile** | the facet row, the filter chip, the count — **no party**, because a queue holds many |
| 2 | **Row line** | one record's Actions cell — **names the party**, because a row is one order |
| 3 | **Button** | the button that does it, inside the drawer or the form |
| 4 | **Done message** | the confirmation after it is recorded |
| 5 | **Empty state** | what the queue says when it holds nothing (why · when it changes · what to do meanwhile) |

**Five filled = designed. One missing = not designed — do not open a card for it.**

**A `—` is a filled cell, not a missing one.** It means *this action has no such string, and
here is why* — `Delay planning` has no done message because the row leaves by itself and the
action that follows it says what happened. An EMPTY cell is the undesigned case. The
difference matters because C8 stopped and asked on exactly this square, which is the behaviour
the rule wants.

**The two answers and the tooltip are part of the design too.** Where an action asks a
question, the answers are locked strings like any other:

| Action | The question | The answers | The queue tooltip |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Delay planning` | can the promised date still be met? | `We can still make the promised date` · `We cannot make the promised date` | `Supplier date lands after the promised date — decide before anyone calls (Delay planning)` |
| `Confirm tomorrow's delivery` | is it coming on the day we expect it? | `It ships on {date}` · `It ships later than {date}` | — (none: the tile's own label is already the whole instruction, and this file's tooltip rule says delete a tooltip that would restate the label) |

Both answers name **the promised date** rather than "yes" and "no", because the reader must
not have to remember what was asked.

**`Confirm tomorrow's delivery`'s two answers name the DATE for a second reason, and Loo said
it in one line when he ruled them (2026-07-29):** *"These answers remain true regardless of
when the user opens the action."* The action opens the working day before the goods are due and
stays open until somebody answers it — so a relative word is only true on the first day.
`Shipping tomorrow`, answered two days late, is a sentence about a day that has already passed.
`{date}` is the PO's expected arrival, and it is right whenever it is read.

**`Confirm balance delivery date` gets no row here and that is a filled answer, not a missing
one**: it asks no question. It records ONE date, so its Button (`Record balance date`) is the
whole interaction and there is nothing for a second string to say.
The code mirror is `packages/shared/order-action-words.ts`; that module and this
table are one-to-one, so a queue and a row can never spell one action two ways.

**ORDERS + DELIVERY** (shipped C1, PR #461):

| Queue tile | Row line | Button | Done message | Empty state |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Issue PO` · `Confirm ready date` | **→ defined once in the PURCHASING table below.** The Orders ladder DISPLAYS these two; it does not respell them. *(This row replaces the old `Send PO` entry — `Send PO` is retired, and so are `Prepare PO` and the Draft PO it produced.)* | | | |
| `Assign logistics` | `Assign logistics` | `Assign logistics` | `{logistics} assigned` | `Every order has a logistics company.` |
| `Confirm delivery date` | `Call {logistics} — confirm delivery date` | `Confirm booking` | `Delivery confirmed {date} · {slot}` | `0 calls to make · everything on track.` |
| `Issue delivery order` | `Issue delivery order` | `Issue delivery order` | `Delivery order issued` | `Nothing waiting for a delivery order.` |
| `Deliver today` | `Deliver today` | `Mark delivered` | `Delivered` | `No deliveries today.` |
| `Upload delivery photo` | `Upload delivery photo` | `Upload delivery photo` | `Delivery photo saved` | `Every delivery has its photo.` |
| `Delay planning` | `Delay planning` | `Record the delay decision` | — (none: the row leaves by itself, and `Arrange new delivery date` says what happened) | `No supplier date lands after a promised date.` |
| `Arrange new delivery date` | `Call {logistics} — arrange new delivery date` | `Record new date` | `New date recorded` | `No delayed order needs a new date.` |
| `Collect RM {amount}` | `Collect RM {amount} from {customer}` | `Record payment` | `Payment recorded` | `Nothing outstanding.` |

**PURCHASING** (`docs/PURCHASING-WORKING-FLOW.md`):

| Queue tile | Row line | Button | Done message | Empty state |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Issue PO` | `Issue PO to {supplier}` | `Issue PO` | `PO issued to {supplier}` | `No purchase orders to issue.` |
| `Confirm ready date` | `Call {supplier} — confirm ready date` | `Record ready date` | `Ready date recorded` | `No supplier to call today. Everything on track.` |
| `Confirm tomorrow's delivery` | `Call {supplier} — confirm tomorrow's delivery` | `Record answer` | `Answer recorded` | `Nothing arriving tomorrow.` |
| `Check in` | `Check in from {supplier}` | `Check in` | `Checked in {n} of {m}` | `No goods arriving today. {supplier}'s next delivery is {date}.` |
| `Confirm balance delivery date` | `Call {supplier} — confirm balance delivery date` | `Record balance date` | `Balance date recorded` | `Nothing short today.` |
| `Confirm what happens next` | `Call {supplier} — confirm what happens next` | `Record what happens next` | `Supplier answer recorded` | `No claim is waiting for a supplier answer.` |

**THIS TABLE IS THE CANONICAL HOME FOR EVERY PURCHASING ACTION, INCLUDING THE ONES THE ORDERS
LADDER DISPLAYS.** The Orders row and the Purchasing row show the same work, so `Issue PO`
and `Confirm ready date` are defined **once, here**. The ORDERS table above points
at this one; it does not respell them.

*(This replaces the rule that `Send PO` and `Confirm ready date` were ONE action each "shared
by Orders and Purchasing … listed twice". Loo deleted that statement on 2026-07-29: the
requirement it created — that both flows carry an identical entry — is what made the
Purchasing split unbuildable without dragging Orders' wording along. **Defining an action
once and referencing it is stronger than defining it twice and promising the copies match.**)*

> **`Send PO` IS GONE FROM PURCHASING (Loo, 2026-07-29), AND SO ARE `Prepare PO` AND
> `Draft PO` (Loo, 2026-07-30 — the Purchasing clean restart).** Raising a purchase order is
> ONE act — **`Issue PO`** creates the formal Purchase Order, and nothing is stored before it.
> The old done message `PO sent to {supplier}` described a step that no longer exists. The verb `Send`
> is retired with it and stays banned from reuse — see the verb dictionary.

**RETIRED, and it is not in the table above because it is no longer an action**
(C3, PR #479): the old bare `Confirm` fired when everything was already arranged
and the day had simply not come — the one drawer row no button could close. It is
now a FACT: `Delivering 27 Jul · 9-11 AM` in the drawer, the bare word
`Delivering` in the row, because the Delivery cell beside it already prints the
day.

**FACTS (the delivery column, badges):**

| Ships today | Verdict | Must become |
|---|---|---|
| `confirmed 27 Jul · 9–11 AM` | ✅ keep | — |
| `not confirmed · logistics said 27 Jul` | ✅ keep | — |
| `need booking` | **to-do word in a fact** | `{logistics} — confirm delivery date` |
| `Unscheduled` | banned (T1) | `{logistics} — confirm delivery date` |
| `No logistics` | ✅ keep | (states an absence, no to-do word; the Actions column carries `Assign logistics`) |

**FILTER / STATE words** live in FILTERS only (C-vocab, Jess 2026-07-19) and are nouns,
not actions: `All · Placed · Proceed · Scheduled · Delivered · Owing`. **`Pending` is
banned even as a filter** — pending on what? Rename it to the state it actually selects
when C1 reaches it.

**Adopted from the PORTAL_CORE vocabulary proposal:** the ban on `Chase`, on `At Risk` /
`Attention` / `Pending`, and the rule that a label names measurable work.
**Deliberately NOT adopted:** its ban on the WORD "customer" as a party (when no name is
stored, the role word is the honest answer), and its "Confirm Supplier Stock ETA" phrasing
(our shape puts the party first: `Call Ohana — confirm ready date`).

### Where the goods go — the PO destination words (locked by Loo, 2026-07-29)

The concept is already in the vocabulary table below (`where the goods go`, with `Ship-to` ·
`Destination` · `Drop point` banned). These are the STRINGS.

| What | The word |
|---|---|
| The field label, on the PO form and the external document | **`Where the goods go`** |
| The three options | **`Carres Klang`** · **`AL Sungai Buloh`** · **`HOUZS`** |
| Nice Future, which does not deliver | **`NETS collects from Nice Future and delivers to Carres Klang.`** |
| The optional free-text field beside it | **`Delivery instructions`** |
| A destination nobody has given an address for — **Settings only** | **`Address not set`** |

**The PO and the external document print the SAVED destination name**, never a re-derived one
and never one of the banned nouns. That is why the name is stored rather than mapped from a
code in the UI: a document a supplier holds must still read the same after somebody renames a
destination on screen.

**`HOUZS` is the option word and it is deliberately shorter than the place.** The warehouse the
business says out loud is "HOUZS Balakong"; Loo ruled the option `HOUZS`. Do not "complete" it
— a chat that helpfully expands it has invented a fourth string.

**`Address not set` is a SETTINGS word and appears nowhere else** (Loo, 2026-07-29). It is a
FACT stating an absence, which the fact/action rule allows, and it carries no to-do word. It
may not leak onto a PO, onto the external document, or into an error a store reads: **a PO may
stay a draft while its external destination has no address, and it may not be issued, exported
or sent until the address is complete** — that refusal is enforced in the database, not by this
string. `Carres Klang` never shows it: its address is derived from the own warehouse record.

### Facet group headings (locked 2026-07-28, after P2-Claims found they had no home)

The facet rail's ORDER is `docs/UI-KIT.md` §8.4; the WORDS are here. A module picks the
headings it needs from this list and adds none.

| Heading | What sits under it |
|---|---|
| `Queues` | the module's open actions — each row's name IS its action, from the dictionary above |
| `Supplier` · `Logistics` · `Customer` | the outside party |
| `Problem` | what went wrong (claim type, delay reason, issue type) |
| `Stock` · `Region` · `Category` · `Store` | facts about the record |
| `Due` | when it turns late |

**A heading is a NOUN and never an action** — `Queues` holds actions, it is not one.
A group with one row still gets its heading: a lone unlabelled row reads as a stray.

**Only a fact may be a filter** (the UI type dictionary above), so every heading except
`Queues` names a fact. That is also why there is no `Status` heading — status is the pill on
the row, and a facet filtering by it would compete with the queue rows for the same job.

**Need one that is not here?** It is a word, so it is a decision — ask, do not invent. This
table exists because three headings shipped on a real screen with nothing to check them
against.

### The verb dictionary — portal-wide (locked 2026-07-27)

**SIX verbs, six meanings. Every module uses these; no module invents a seventh.**

*(It was five until 2026-07-28. `Return` was added by Loo's ruling because R6 needed a word
for "this record goes back to whoever produced it" and reached for `Send back`. **`Prepare`
was added 2026-07-29 and RETIRED 2026-07-30** with the Purchasing clean restart: raising a
purchase order is one act again, so the verb has no object left. **The bar for a seventh is
the bar `Return` cleared: no existing verb fits, and the alternative is a module inventing
its own.**)*

**They govern WORKLIST ACTIONS, not form buttons.** A button inside a form that stores what
you just typed is `Save`, and one that abandons it is `Cancel` — those are not actions, they
never appear in a queue, and they need no verb from this table.

**The CHANNEL is not the action.** `Call {supplier} — confirm what happens next` is the same
action whether it is done by phone, by WhatsApp or in person: outward communication whose
outcome is recorded. A button that opens WhatsApp or copies the message is HOW,
not WHAT — never a second action.
**`Send` IS RETIRED AS AN ACTION VERB (2026-07-29, P6) AND STAYS BANNED FROM REUSE.** It was
pinned to raising a purchase order to a factory; the frozen lifecycle replaced that single
act with **`Issue PO`**, so **no action in the portal is named `Send`
any more.** The pin does not lift with it: `Send` may still never be reused for "this message
leaves our company" (rule 8), for returning a record (`Return`), or for anything else. A word
with no owner is not a free word — it is a word one module is about to claim.

#### The WhatsApp button — the label says which door it opens (Loo, 2026-07-28)

**The word follows the BEHAVIOUR, not the other way round.** There are two doors and they are
not the same thing, so they do not share a label:

| What the button actually opens | The label |
|---|---|
| a `wa.me/{phone}` chat with ONE named party | **`Open WhatsApp`** |
| the supplier's saved WhatsApp GROUP link | **`Open WhatsApp group`** |
| nothing — it puts the message on the clipboard | **`Copy message`** |

**Why this needed ruling rather than reuse.** The table above used to give only
`Open WhatsApp group`, and R8 stopped on it (2026-07-28) rather than applying it: the To Order
button opens a **direct chat** when the factory has a contact number and only falls back to the
group, so `group` would have been a word that is false about half the time. A label that names
a door the click does not open is worse than a vague one — the operator learns to stop reading
it.

**This rules ONE button label and changes no other WhatsApp wording** (Loo's scope). The
message TEMPLATES, the group-link field, `whatsapp_group_url` and every existing sentence
about WhatsApp stay exactly as they are.

**A button whose behaviour is conditional takes the label of the door it will actually open**,
resolved at render time from what is on file — never a third blended word covering both.

| Verb | Means | Completion is |
|---|---|---|
| **Assign** | an INTERNAL decision — we choose who | the object is chosen. **Never** "the other side accepted" — acceptance is a later, separate action |
| **Call** | OUTWARD communication — we ask someone for information | the information is obtained **and recorded in the system**. A call with nothing recorded is not complete |
| **Issue** | the SYSTEM produces a formal document | the document exists |
| **Upload** | evidence is attached | the file exists |
| **Close** | a case or claim is finished and its record is sealed | the record can no longer change |
| **Return** | a record goes BACK to the party that produced it, for them to act on | the record is with them **and its state says so on their screen** |

Examples: `Assign logistics` · `Assign PIC` · `Assign warehouse picker` ·
`Call {supplier} — confirm ready date` · `Call {logistics} — confirm delivery date` ·
`Call {logistics} — arrange new delivery date` · `Issue invoice` · `Issue credit note` ·
`Upload delivery photo` · `Upload payment proof` · `Return count to Carres` ·
`Return count to {warehouse}`.

### The warehouse count words (Loo, 2026-07-28)

**One verb, two directions, and the party is always named.** `Send back` is retired: `Send`
is pinned to raising a purchase order to a factory and is never reused (rule 8).

| Who does it | Queue tile | Row line | Button | Done message | Empty state |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| the warehouse files its count | `Return count` | `Return count to Carres` | `Return count to Carres` | `Count returned to Carres` | `Nothing counted and waiting.` |
| Carres sends it back to be redone | `Return count` | `Return count to {warehouse}` | `Return count to {warehouse}` | `Count returned to {warehouse}` | `No count is waiting for a check.` |

The queue word is the same for both because a queue holds many and names no party — which is
the dictionary's own rule, and here it is load-bearing rather than incidental: the two rows
are the same act seen from the two ends.

**This replaces R6's `Save count` on the warehouse form, and that is deliberate.** The form
law says a button that merely stores what you typed is `Save` — but this one does not merely
store: it hands the count to Carres and the state becomes `Waiting Carres check`. A button
that changes whose problem something is has never been a `Save`.

**These four strings cover the WAREHOUSE RECEIPT and nothing else** (Loo, 2026-07-28). See the
rule directly below — a different business line does not inherit them by looking similar.

### One business, one dictionary (Loo, 2026-07-28)

**A shared SHAPE is not a shared WORD.** Ready Stock's plan review also has a button that
sends a record back to whoever produced it (`OperationStockPlan.tsx`). It is the same shape as
the warehouse count and it does NOT get `Return count to …`, and it does not get renamed as a
side effect of the receiving line's sweep: **a plan is not a count, and Ready Stock must
define its own flow and its own dictionary rows first.**

**This does not weaken rule 8, it says where rule 8 applies.** Rule 8 is *one business fact,
one word, everywhere it appears* — `Confirm ready date` reads the same on Orders and on
Purchasing because it is the same fact. It was never *"two actions that look alike must share
a label"*, and reading it that way is how a word gets stretched over a second business until
it means neither.

**The test, in one question:** would a new hire doing BOTH jobs be surprised that the two
screens use one word? If the objects differ — a count of goods vs a proposal about stock —
they would, and the word is wrong however similar the click feels.

**So the sequence is fixed:** the module writes its flow → the flow names its actions → those
actions get their five strings here → only then does a screen change. A rename that arrives
before the flow is a chat guessing on behalf of a business line that has not spoken.

**Consequence of the Issue rule:** the SYSTEM writes the document; the human only presses
the button. **`Issue delivery order` IS an action** (Jess ruled 2026-07-27): once the
customer's date is confirmed, the operator presses one button and the document exists, ready
to hand to logistics. Today `orders.do_number` is stamped by a DB trigger on the DISPATCH
transition (0098) — a day too late to give logistics the paper they ask for the evening
before. Card C7 moves the stamp to customer confirmation. Nobody ever authors a delivery
order by hand.

### The Receiving Workspace's own words (locked 2026-08-03, Slice B)

`Check in` above is the ACT and stays the queue word. These are the words the
Office Receiving Workspace puts on screen while performing it — they name
sections, fields and the state of the Save button, so they are not actions and
do not take the five-string shape.

| Word | Where | Why this word |
|---|---|---|
| `Receiving Summary` | workspace section | **Never `Progress`** (Jess): the section answers *what has this PO taken in*, a count, not a stage. |
| `Received` · `Outstanding` | the summary's two rows | Outstanding is PRINTED, not left as `5 − 3`. An operator should never subtract to learn what is still owed. |
| `Start Receiving` | primary action | A PRIMARY ACTION, never a section — the operator's whole job here is one press. |
| `Receiving Details` | the strip Receiving Mode adds | What this delivery was, as opposed to what was on it. |
| `Goods Received At` | field | The Business Date Dictionary's own word — when the goods PHYSICALLY arrived, which is not when they were keyed in. |
| `Supplier DO No.` | field | **Theirs, not ours.** It has no default and no suggestion; a number we invent is a reference the supplier never issued. |
| `Signed DO photo` | field | The evidence, named by what it is a photo OF. |
| `Receive now` | per-line input | *"Receive this time"*, never *"total so far"* — the column beside it already says `Received`. |
| `What kind of wrong?` | per-line picker | Plain words. The claim needs the kind before it can be filed. |
| `Save Receiving` | the Save button, when nothing is missing | |
| `Save — {what is missing}` | the Save button otherwise | The button NAMES the gap: `Save — add a DO number` · `Save — upload signed DO` · `Save — count at least one unit`. A grey button that will not say why is a puzzle. |
| `Remaining after save: {n} (stays on this PO)` | beside Save | Quiet, never a popup: a short receipt is normal, and routine confirms train people to click OK. |
| `No receiving activity yet.` | Activity empty state | **Never `Nothing received yet`** (Jess, 2026-08-03) — that reads as *the goods have not come*, which is a different fact and usually a false one. What is empty is the RECORD. |
| `Open in Claims` | Exceptions section | A DOOR, never a form. The claim already exists; the receive that recorded the problem opened it. |

### Receiving and supplier-exception words (locked 2026-07-27)

One vocabulary for every module that waits on a supplier. Never invent a synonym.

| Group | The words |
|---|---|
| Receiving result | `Received` · `Received with exception` · `Rejected` |
| Exception lifecycle | `Receiving exception created` · **`Call {supplier} — confirm what happens next`** · `Waiting supplier reply` · `Waiting goods arrival` · `Overdue goods arrival` · `Supplier cannot fulfil` · `Case owner decision required` · `Exception closed` |

**`Contact supplier` is retired** (Loo, 2026-07-28). It was a SIXTH verb for behaviour the
five already cover — reach the outside party, get an answer, record the outcome, which is
exactly `Call`. The action is `Call {supplier} — confirm what happens next` and its five
strings are in the dictionary above. **The R2/R3 screens still say `Contact`; the rename is
scheduled in the ④ R lane** — until it lands, this table is the ruling and the screen is the
lag, not the other way round.

**Waiting words are STATES, never actions** — nobody acts while one is true (engine law).
**Every module fails the same way:** one `Exception` plus a `Reason`, never a family of
different failure words.

### A number is not a status until someone sets a target (locked 2026-07-27)

A percentage, a count or a rate is a FACT. It gets a colour only when a human has set the
line it is being judged against. Painting 82% amber invents a policy nobody ruled, and the
reader cannot tell an opinion from a measurement.

Two consequences, both already shipped: **a rate with too few records is not printed at
all** — `0 ÷ 0` shown as `0%` reads "this supplier never delivers on time" and shown as
`100%` reads "perfect", and both are lies a screen tells with a straight face (R5); and
**"nobody has set a number yet" is its own visible state**, never a reassuring green
(K1's `Set a number`). A quiet screen must mean *watched and fine*, never *nobody looked*.

### Working days — THREE calendars, and this file does not define them

**Office Mon–Fri · Warehouse Mon–Sat · Delivery Mon–Fri + a reduced Saturday** (Loo
2026-07-28). The definition lives in **`docs/ACTION-FLOW-STANDARD.md` Law 2A** and nowhere
else — this file owns WORDS, not the engine.

*(Until 2026-07-28 the full definition sat here AND in Law 2, both saying "Monday–Saturday,
one definition for every module". Two homes for one rule, and the rule itself was the
warehouse's week wearing everybody's name. Deleted here rather than corrected in two
places — Law 0A.)*

### UI type dictionary (locked 2026-07-27)

Every visible element has exactly one allowed shape. If a string does not fit its row,
it is in the wrong element.

| UI element | Must be |
|---|---|
| Action (ladder · queue · button · checklist row) | verb + named party + measurable object |
| Checklist item | one short measurable task |
| Completion rule | a condition the SYSTEM can measure — never "someone did it" |
| Queue | a list of open Actions (its name IS the action) |
| Dashboard tile | a count of open Actions |
| Badge | fact only |
| Status dot | fact only |
| Filter | fact only |
| Bulk action | verb + PLURAL object (`Send 12 POs` · `Call 8 suppliers — confirm ready date`) |

**Banned words — never visible anywhere** (each names a mood or a gap instead of work):

`Chase` · `POD` / `Proof of Delivery` · `Unscheduled` · `Not booked` · `need booking` ·
`Pending` · `Processing` · `In Progress` · `At Risk` · `Attention` ·
`Inventory` · `Movements` · `Recovery` **in the delay sense** (staff say "this order going to
delay" — the word on screen is `Delay planning`)

**`Recovery` is banned by MEANING, not by spelling.** Account recovery on the login page is a
different word that happens to be spelt the same, and it stays. C8 grepped the live bundle,
found `Recovery` nine times, and correctly changed none: eight are React internals
(`errorRecoveryDisabledLanes`) and the ninth is `Login.tsx`'s forgot-password dialog. **A
banned word is banned where it names the banned concept** — a chat sweeping this list by
string match will rename the login page and call it compliance.

(Filters may name a real STATE — `Placed`, `Proceed`, `Delivered`, `Owing` — but never
one of the words above.)

**`Waiting` alone is banned; `Waiting <the exact thing>` is allowed as a STATE.**
`Waiting` on its own tells the reader nothing — waiting for what? But
`Waiting supplier reply` and `Waiting goods arrival` name precisely what is being waited
for, and they are states, not actions: **nobody acts while one is true.** Never use such a
phrase as an action label, and never shorten one to the bare word. (Ruled 2026-07-27 after
S4 found this file banning a word its own receiving vocabulary approved.)

**The no-decorative-checkbox law.** A checklist item may exist only if it is either
(a) DERIVED from a signal the system already stores, or (b) an input the system then
stores. **A tick-box that only records "I say I did it" is banned** — it turns the portal
into a manual to-do list and lets an order look complete when nothing happened. Where a
FORM already collects the inputs (the PO form, the confirm-booking form), that form IS the
checklist — never a second list of ticks beside it.

## Vocabulary — the canonical words

Use these words EVERYWHERE. Never a synonym in a different page. When in
doubt, grep the codebase and match what already ships.

| Concept | Canonical word | Do NOT use |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Raise a purchase order to a factory — **it is ONE act, never two** | **`Issue PO`** (the formal PO exists) | **Send PO** · **Prepare PO** · **Draft PO** — all retired · Place · Raise · Push · Submit · Create |
| Pre-due polite follow-up on an open PO | **Remind** | Notify · Ping · Alert · Nudge |
| Post-due firm follow-up on an open PO | **Call {supplier} — confirm ready date** | Chase · Expedite · Follow up · Push · Escalate |
| Log goods arrival — the ACT | **Check in** | Receive (as a verb) · Book in · Goods receipt · **GRN** (that is the document, not the act) |
| The DOCUMENT that the act produces | **GRN** | Goods receipt note · Receiving note · Check-in record |
| An order line's goods are secured for that order | **Ready** | Reserved — on an order line it is read as `Received`, and the two mean opposite things. `Reserved` stays correct on the Stock screens, where it describes a UNIT and sits nowhere near `Received` |
| Customer confirmed ETA — ready for PO | **Proceed** | Confirmed · Approved · Green-lit |
| Customer ordered but no ETA yet | **Placed** | New · Draft · Pending · Open — **and this ban is about a CUSTOMER ORDER only. See the Purchasing exception below: `Draft` and `Issued` are ruled words on the Purchase Order axis** |
| Cancel an order | **Cancel** | Void · Abandon · Kill |
| Purchase order (the document) | **PO** | Purchase order · P/O · Order (ambiguous with customer order) |
| Customer's own order | **Order** (or `SO-1207`) | Sales order · Job · Ticket |
| The To Order stages | **`Confirm ready date` · `Issue PO`** — in that display order (`docs/ACTION-FLOW-STANDARD.md` Law 4 rung 3) | Chase · Place · Follow up · Book in · **`Send PO`** · **`Prepare PO`** · **`Receive` as a To Order stage** (it left for Receiving on the deadline-anchor boundary) |
| Photo proving a delivery happened | **delivery photo** | POD · Proof of Delivery · e-POD |
| Mattress + bed frame as one delivery | **Bed set** | Bedroom set · Bundle · Bed package |
| A follow-up delivery on the same order | **Second trip** | Partial delivery · Split shipment · Back-order |
| Getting a faulty item back from the customer | **`Pick up the item from {customer}`** | Collect the item · Retrieve · Recall — `Collect` means MONEY in this portal (Jess 2026-07-27) |
| Working out what to do about a delay, before anyone calls the customer | **`Delay planning`** | Recovery · Recovery plan · Exception handling · Escalation |
| Telling logistics to re-arrange a delayed delivery | **`Call {logistics} — arrange new delivery date`** | Call customer (stock delay) · Inform customer · Reschedule |
| Call to fix delivery date + slot | **Call {customer} — book delivery date** | Schedule delivery · Chase · Call customer (book delivery) [old T2 spelling] |
| The delivery company (any page/label) | **Logistics** (with s) · a named one reads `NETS Logistics` | Logistic · Carrier · Partner · Delivery partner |
| The goods pool (any page/tab/label) | **Stock** | Inventory · Warehouse (as a menu word) |
| Stock in/out history (tab/label) | **In & out** | Movements · Movement log (menu) · Ledger |
| A logistics company's own working rules | **delivery rules** | Partner profile · SLA · Carrier config |
| Notice logistics need before a delivery day | **working days notice** | Lead time · Cut-off · Booking window |
| A date logistics are closed | **not running on** | Blackout · Unavailable · Out of service |
| Most drops logistics take in a day | **deliveries a day** | Capacity · Max load · Slots |
| How long a factory takes to make an item | **production working days** | Lead time · Manufacturing lead · Turnaround |
| The days a factory is open | **Supplier work week** | working days · Work-week · Factory calendar · Shift pattern |
| The earliest delivery date a store may sell | **Earliest date a store may sell** | Lead time · Minimum lead · Sell-from date · Earliest available |
| The last day we may send the PO and still be safe | **order-by date** | Raise-by · Trigger date · Reorder date |
| The days of the week we send POs | **PO days** | Cycle · Review day · Batch day |
| Days kept back for arranging the delivery | **order-by buffer** | Safety stock days · Slack · Padding |
| Where the supplier must send the goods | **where the goods go** | Ship-to · Destination · Drop point |
| What is still owed after a short delivery | **balance** | Outstanding qty · Back-order · Shortfall |
| Goods moved between our own locations | **stock transfer** | Relocation · Internal shipment · Redeployment |
| The drawer panel listing who to ring, one row per outside party | **Calls** | Chase Now · Actions · Follow-ups · Contacts — `Actions` is the ROW's open-action list and one word may not head two blocks (Jess 2026-07-28, PR #487); the panel's own empty state has read `0 calls to make · everything on track.` since C1, so the title is that sentence's noun, not a new word |

## The Purchase Order lifecycle words — CANONICAL HOME (Loo, 2026-07-29 · frozen by P6)

**Every Purchasing word lives here. No other file may redefine one; they reference this
section.** `docs/PURCHASING-WORKING-FLOW.md` owns what the actions DO,
`docs/PURCHASING-INFORMATION-MODEL.md` owns where the facts sit — neither respells a word.

**This is a PURCHASING exception to two rows in the vocabulary table above, and it is
deliberate.** A Purchase Order and a customer order are two different subjects; a word banned
on one is not automatically banned on the other. **`Draft` and `Open` stay banned for a
CUSTOMER ORDER.**

**Action ≠ Status. They may never be mixed.** An action is something a person does and it
LEAVES when its outcome is recorded. A status is what the PO currently is.

### The five Operation Status labels — the ONLY five

| # | Label | Means |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`Issued`** | a formal PO has been created and issued |
| 2 | **`In Production`** | supplier fulfilment is underway |
| 3 | **`Receiving`** | physical goods receipt has started |
| 4 | **`Completed`** | the PO is fully received and no remaining purchasing action exists |
| 5 | **`Cancelled`** | the PO will no longer be fulfilled |

**`Open` is never a Purchase Order status.** The word for a PO that has been issued is
`Issued`. (`Open` also reads as "not yet finished", which is a different fact and is what
`Receiving` says.)

**Supplier Status is a SEPARATE axis** — what the factory and the logistics partner report.
It is never merged into the five above, and it is not Purchasing's to redefine: two external
roles run their whole lifecycle on it.

### The Purchasing nouns and facts

| Concept | Canonical word | Do NOT use |
|---|---|---|
| Demand somebody has consciously reviewed and delayed | region **`Purchasing on Hold`** · row fact **`On hold until {date}`**, carrying **Held by** · **Reason** · **Held time** · **Resume date** | Snoozed · Paused · Excluded · Hidden · Pending |
| An item whose supplier cannot be worked out | **`Supplier not assigned`** — a FACT, under Missing Configuration. Supporting line: `Assign a supplier before this item can enter the purchasing plan.` | Orphan · Unknown supplier · Invalid SKU · Supplier error |

### The Report words (Loo, 2026-08-04 — card Q3)

Purchasing has a "look at the numbers" layer, and these are the only words on
it. **Six were ruled; the page may use no seventh.**

| What | The word | Note |
|---|---|---|
| the tab | **`Report`** — **singular** | Loo's own spelling, given verbatim, and it is AutoCount's own menu-bar word, which the team reads daily. **`Reports` and `Reporting` are both wrong; do not "correct" it** |
| a column: how many purchase orders | **`POs`** | the plural of `PO`, the document's own name |
| a column: the quantity we asked the factory for | **`Ordered`** | |
| a column: what physically arrived | **`Received`** | already ruled — the Receiving Workspace's word, reused, not respelt |
| a column: what is still owed | **`Outstanding`** | already ruled — and **its own rule binds here**: it is PRINTED, never left as `19 − 0` for the reader to subtract |
| the last row | **`Total`** | |

**No money appears anywhere on this page** (Loo, 2026-08-04): *"i dont show
costing — due to supplier have own, finance will deal with it. If future need
to add, just add, not now."* It is structural rather than remembered — the wire
carries no price field at all, so the page could not print one.

**The rail's headings are `Month` · `Supplier` · `Category`.** The last two are
the facet-group headings ruled above. **`Month` has no row in this file** — it
is reused verbatim from the portal's own live screens (HR's commission-run
column, Finance's month picker) rather than invented, and it is reported here so
the next chat finds it. **There is deliberately no `Status` facet**: the
facet-heading rule above bans one by name, and measured 2026-08-04 all 21 live
purchase orders sit in one state, so the group could narrow nothing.

**Communication is NOT part of the PO lifecycle** (Loo, 2026-07-29). WhatsApp and Email are
channels that may vary per supplier; they are never a status, never an Operation Status value,
and they occupy no position in the purchasing information model. The channel words themselves
are unchanged (`Open WhatsApp` · `Open WhatsApp group`).

**The eight terminology slots that stood open from 2026-07-29 are CLOSED by this section.**
Every word above is ruled. No terminology placeholder is left in Purchasing, and a chat that finds
one has found a document that was missed.

## The delivery calendar words (T10, locked with Jess 2026-07-27)

A calendar day answers ONE question: **which trucks move that day.** A day is
therefore filled by the BOOKING, never by the date we promised the customer —
those two dates diverge the moment anything is rescheduled, which is why D1
split them.

| Concept | Canonical word | Do NOT use |
|---|---|---|
| The three calendar views | **Today · Tomorrow · This week** | Next 7 days · Week view · Upcoming |
| The customer said yes to this date | **Confirmed** (+ the slot, e.g. `12pm–3pm`) | Booked · Locked · Scheduled |
| Only logistics have named this date | **Logistics' date** | Provisional · Tentative · ETA · Pencilled in · Carrier's date |
| Promised on this day, no booking yet | **Promised this day, no date yet** | Unscheduled · Not booked · Unbooked · Pending · anything with "needs" |
| No logistics picked yet | **No logistics picked** | Unassigned · TBD · No carrier · — |
| Nothing booked on a day | **No deliveries booked this day.** | Empty · Free · Nothing |

- **"This week" means the REST of this week** — today through Saturday. Sunday
  is never in a delivery range: it is refused for every logistics company.
- A promised-but-unbooked order is never COUNTED as a delivery. It is listed
  under its own heading with the call that fixes it
  (`Call {customer} — book delivery date`), so a day never reads as empty when
  work is sitting on it, and never reads as booked when nothing is.
- Confirmed is the ONLY green on the calendar, exactly as in the Orders list's
  Delivery column (T1). The logistics company's own date is amber, always.

## The delivery window words (locked with Jess 2026-07-27)

**How long a delivery takes depends on the building**, and the POS already asks: the
customer step carries a building type (`Landed · Condo · Apartment · Office · Retail ·
Other`), stored in `entry_data.fields.building_type`. Today **nothing reads it** — it is
printed in the drawer and no rule uses it.

| Building type | The window | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `Landed` · `Retail` | **Full-day delivery** | the truck drives up to the door |
| `Condo` · `Apartment` · `Office` | **Half-day delivery** | the lift must be booked and the driver must report in |
| `Other` / not filled | **Full-day delivery**, and the booking is refused until it is filled | see the ruling below — the refusal STANDS |

**Building type is MANDATORY at go-live, and the blanks are not a reason to soften it**
(Loo, 2026-07-28). Measured live 2026-07-28, and the split matters:

```
37 AutoCount import rows   37 blank   0 filled   ← test data, gone at go-live
19 portal orders            3 blank  16 filled   ← the POS does NOT require the field TODAY
```

Those **3** are the real finding, not the 37. They are portal orders, and they are blank
because the POS writes the field only when it is non-empty — so "mandatory" is a change the
POS still has to make, not a state it is already in. The 37 disappear by themselves when the
database starts clean.

**Therefore the rule is not softened to fit them.** "No building type → no booking" stands as
written. This is CLAUDE.md's standing law made concrete: *test data is evidence about whether
CODE WORKS, never a reason to change what the business does.* A chat that meets those 40
blanks must not propose a default, a grandfather clause or a "legacy" branch — it must check
whether the row is an import, and the answer is that all 40 are.

Fixed phrasings — reuse, never invent a variant:

- The fact: `Half-day delivery · condominium` · `Full-day delivery`
- The refusal: `Fill in the building type first — a condominium can only take a
  half-day delivery.`

**Never** write "access restrictions", "site constraints", "delivery window policy" or
"lift booking required" on screen. Say what the building is and how long the truck has.

## The Delivery module words (T11, locked with Jess 2026-07-27)

The standalone Delivery page adds **no new vocabulary**. Its queue names, its
action pills and its calendar lines are the words already ruled above, taken
from the same shared constants the Orders list reads — a module that spelt a
queue differently would be rule 8's failure with its own menu item. Only these
four strings are the page's own:

| Concept | Canonical word | Do NOT use |
|---|---|---|
| The two views of the module | **Queues · Calendar** | List · Board · Schedule · Planner |
| How much work is on the board | **{n} to do · {n} late** | Total · Outstanding · Open items |
| Nothing in the picked queue | **Nothing to do here.** + the sentence saying when an order joins | No results · Empty · All clear |
| Leaving the module to act | **Open order** | View · Details · Go to order · Edit |

**The module states facts and hands over.** Every write — booking a date,
recording a reason, uploading a delivery photo — happens in the order drawer,
which is where the gates live. So the page carries exactly ONE button, and its
word says where it takes you.

**The delivery-rule word law (T9, Jess 2026-07-27):** every one of these lines
WARNS and none of them blocks, so every one of them must name the logistics company and
end in something the operator can do — "call them" or "pick another day". A
warning that only states a fact ("capacity exceeded") tells a new hire nothing
about the next second. Sunday never appears in a logistics company's rules: it is refused
for everyone, and a per-partner Sunday line would read as though a phone call
could buy one.

**The Logistics word law (Jess 2026-07-27).** Jess: "our english bad — logistic & logistics
we don't see different", so this was decided rather than asked again. **`Logistics`, always
with the s** — it is the correct English noun and it reads naturally with the company names
staff already say (`NETS Logistics`). `Carrier`, `Partner` and `Delivery partner` are banned
UI words (DB table names keep theirs). The rename is free: C1 is already rewriting every one
of those strings.

**The three-dot column has NO header (Jess 2026-07-27).** The dots are three independent
facts, not one status. `Status` is wrong and `Checks` reads as "cheques" beside money — so
the column carries no header word, and each dot is labelled by its own small icon (goods ·
delivery · money) from the portal icon set, never emoji (UI-KIT). The actions column IS
headed, and its word is **`Actions`** — plural, because an order can have several.

**The Stock word law (K0, Jess 2026-07-27):** one warehouse, three questions —
`On hand` (what's here now) · `Ready stock` (how much to keep — a PLAN about
the same goods, never a second pool) · `In & out` (when things moved).
"Inventory" and "Movements" are banned UI words (POD treatment); internal
keys/routes keep their names.

**Aligning Purchase and Orders panels:** the Orders panel uses **Placed**
for the pre-Proceed state (customer ordered, ETA not confirmed). The
Purchase panel's ① stage fires AFTER Sales clicks Proceed, so it is called
**Send**, not "Place" — otherwise a new hire sees "Place" on two panels
meaning two different things.

---

## Numbers, dates, money

- **Numbers**: tabular-nums font (`tabular-nums` class). `3 units` / `12 orders`.
- **Dates**: use `fmtDate()` from `@/lib/fmt-date` → `19 Jul 26, Sun`. Never
  hand-format. Never `toLocaleDateString`. See UI-KIT §A0 date law.
- **Relative time** (`today`, `2 days ago`) is allowed ONLY in headers or
  lead lines that render live — never in stored text.
- **Currency**: `RM 1,250.00`. Never `$` or `MYR` in row text.

### A money figure is never rounded to make a column tidy (Loo, 2026-07-28)

**Two decimals, always, and the number on screen is the number owed.**

```
✔  Collect RM 1,250.50
✘  Collect RM 1,251          ← rounded up: the screen now asks for 50 sen nobody owes
✘  Collect RM 1,250          ← rounded down: the screen under-states the debt
✘  Collect RM RM 1,250.00    ← the currency word added twice
```

**The reason is not typography.** A collections figure is what a human will say out loud to a
customer and what a receipt must match. Rounding it makes the portal disagree with the ledger,
and it disagrees in whichever direction is worse for whoever is reading. **Visual consistency
with another column is never a reason to change a money figure** — if two columns must line
up, pad them, do not re-value them.

**This confirms the currency rule above rather than adding to it**, and it names the two ways
it has actually been broken so a chat can grep for them:

| The shape | What it means |
|---|---|
| `maximumFractionDigits: 0` on anything a human reads as money | breaks this rule |
| passing an already-formatted `RM …` string into a helper that adds `RM ` itself | prints the word twice |

**Where a helper owns the `RM `, the caller passes the bare number** — that split is the whole
reason both failures exist, so a caller that formats first is the thing to look for.

---

## Header rules (see UI-KIT for the shell)

When a page sits under a module tab bar (Purchasing's `To Order / Purchase
Orders / Receiving / Claims / Settings`), the page does NOT repeat the active tab as
a breadcrumb or big title. **The tab is the title.** Move the freshness
stamp (`Today · Wed 22 Jul`) and refresh icon to the right side of the
tab bar. See `docs/UI-KIT.md` "Module-tab law".

Before merging a UI change:

- [ ] Every button label starts with a verb.
- [ ] Every list row ends with a ≤10-word action-line.
- [ ] Every empty state teaches what to do next.
- [ ] Every error gives the fix.
- [ ] No new synonyms — checked against the vocabulary table above.
- [ ] Zero jargon (rule 9).
- [ ] Tooltips do not repeat the label.
- [ ] Dates go through `fmtDate()`.
